## RPA presents: **Product Randomizer Navigator**

This tool generates products based on user selection of AI-generated categories/subcategories. We used OpenAI's Davinci language model.

1. The user clicks on 1 of 5 AI-generated categories that they want to explore products from.
2. The user clicks on 1 of 5 AI-generated subcategories of the category they want to explore products from.
3. Using the subcategory the AI generates possible products and their prices displayed for the user to see.
4. The user can then reset to look re-visit steps 1-3.
